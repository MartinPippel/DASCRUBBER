                The Dazzler Scrubbing Suite: DAS SCRUBBER

                            Author:  Gene Myers
                            First:   October 12, 2014
                            Recent:  November 4, 2015

  The goal of scrubbing is to produce a set of edited reads that are guaranteed to
(a) be continuous stretches of the underlying genome (i.e. no unremoved adapters
and not chimers), and (b) have no very low quality stretches (i.e. the error rate
never exceeds some reasonable maximum, 20% or so in the case of Pacbio data).  The
secondary goal of scrubbing is to do so with the minimum removal of data and splitting
of reads.

  The "DAS" suite will consist of a pipeline of several programs that will accomplish
the task of scrubbing.  At this time, we are releasing the first program which assigns
intrinsic quality values to every trace point interval of a read.

1. DASqv [-v] -c<int> <source:db> <overlaps:las>

   DASqv takes as input a database <source> and the local alignments, <overlaps>, for
said database or a block thereof.  Note carefully that <source> must always refer to
the entire DB, only <overlaps> can involve a block number.

   Using the local alignment-pile for each A-read, DASqv produces a QV value for each
complete segment of TRACE_SPACING bases (e.g. 100bp, the -s parameter to daligner).
The quality value of a segment is the minimum of 50 and the average percentile of the
best -c alignment matches covering it.  One must supply the -c parameter and it should
be set to 25-50% of the expected coverage of the data set.
   
   The quality values are written to a .qual track, that can be viewed by calling
DBdump with the -i option set ("i" for "intrinsic QV").

   The -v option prints out a histogram of the segment align matches, and the quality
values produced.  This histgram is usefull in assessing, for a given data set, what
constitutes the threshold -g and -b, to be used by down stream commands, for what is
definitely a good segment and what is definitely a bad segment.

2. DBsats [-v] <source:db>

  DBsats generates a mask track "sats" (like the "dust" track of DBdust) for the
reads in <source> where each masked interval contains a micro-sat sequence with a
period of between 1 and 256.

3.  DBpaln [-v] <source:db>

  DBpaln generates a mask track "paln" for the reads in <source> where each masked
interval contains a polindromic or hair-pin element.
